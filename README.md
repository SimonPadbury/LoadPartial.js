# LoadPartial.js

_The world's smallest static site generator!_

`load-partial.js` fetches any text, HTML, or XML file of your choice from anywhere in your website's root folder (or sub-folder) on a server and loads it into an element on your webpage. This can be useful for building sidebar navigation for small websites, or for early-stage web development (prototyping).

**Note:** This script works only for partials that are _hosted within your website_ â€“ it doesn't do cross-site scripting. And it only works via interaction with the web server hosting your website. Therefore, if you are just building your website in your computer without the use of a (virtual) server, Codebase poad-partial won't work.
